# Concurrent Document System

A simulation of a collaborative document platform (e.g., Google Docs) implementing thread synchronization using **reader-writer locks**.

## Core Concept
- **Multiple Readers**: Can access content simultaneously for high concurrency
- **Exclusive Writers**: Get sole access to modify content, ensuring consistency
- **Synchronization**: Balances fairness and prevents thread starvation

## Purpose
An educational project ideal for studying and demonstrating **thread synchronization** patterns in concurrent systems.
